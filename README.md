# NBAR - Node-Based Analog Renderer
---
1. **What is NBAR?**
   - NBAR is a tool for making realistic analog footage [VHS, glitchart, etc.].
2. **How does it work?**
   - NBAR works by doing the following: it converts digital video to analog, applies effects [contrast boost, noise, etc.] to the video with nodes you can change and swap, then converts it back.
3. **Why does NBAR exist?**
   - NBAR exists to remove fake VHS filters that don't look good and aren't accurate off the internet. NBAR is also free, so you don't have to buy a real VCR.
